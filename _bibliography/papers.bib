	title = {Optimal control of a Vlasov--Poisson plasma by fixed magnetic field coils},
  abstract = {We consider the Vlasov--Poisson system that is equipped with an external magnetic field to describe the time evolution of the distribution function of a plasma. An optimal control problem where the external magnetic field is the control itself has already been investigated by Knopf (Calc Var 57:134, 2018). However, in real technical applications it will not be possible to choose the control field in such a general fashion as it will be induced by fixed field coils. In this paper we will use the fundamentals that were established by Knopf (Calc Var 57:134, 2018) to analyze an optimal control problem where the magnetic field is a superposition of the fields that are generated by {\(N\)} fixed magnetic field coils. Thereby, the aim is to control the plasma in such a way that its distribution function matches a desired distribution function at some certain final time {\(T\)} as closely as possible. This problem will be analyzed with respect to the following topics: existence of a globally optimal solution, necessary conditions of first order for local optimality, derivation of an optimality system, sufficient conditions of second order for local optimality and uniqueness of the optimal control under certain conditions.},

	title = {Optimal control of the two-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell system},
  abstract = {The time evolution of a collisionless plasma is modeled by the Vlasov-Maxwell system which couples the Vlasov equation (the transport equation) with the Maxwell equations of electrodynamics. We only consider a two-dimensional version of the problem since existence of global, classical solutions of the full three-dimensional problem is not known. We add external currents to the system, in applications generated by coils, to control the plasma properly. After considering global existence of solutions to this system, differentiability of the control-to-state operator is proved. In applications, on the one hand, we want the shape of the plasma to be close to some desired shape. On the other hand, a cost term penalizing the external currents shall be as small as possible. These two aims lead to minimizing some objective function. We restrict ourselves to only such control currents that are realizable in applications. After that, we prove existence of a minimizer and deduce first order optimality conditions and the adjoint equation.},

We consider the case that the plasma consists of {\(N\)} particle species, the particles are located in a bounded container {\(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3\)}, and are subject to boundary conditions on {\(\partial \Omega\)}. Furthermore, there are external currents, typically in the exterior of the container, that may serve as a control of the plasma if adjusted suitably. We do not impose perfect conductor boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields but consider the fields as functions on whole space {\(\mathbb{R}^3\)} and model objects, that are placed in space, via given matrix-valued functions {\(\varepsilon\)} (the permittivity) and {\(\mu\)} (the permeability). A weak solution concept is introduced and existence of global-in-time solutions is proved, as well as the redundancy of the divergence part of the Maxwell equations in this weak solution concept.},

  abstract = {The time evolution of a collisionless plasma is modeled by the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system which couples the Vlasov equation (the transport equation) with the Maxwell equations of electrodynamics. We consider the case that the plasma is located in a bounded container {\(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3\)}, for example a fusion reactor. Furthermore, there are external currents, typically in the exterior of the container, that may serve as a control of the plasma if adjusted suitably. We model objects, which are placed in space, via given matrix-valued functions {\(\varepsilon\)} (the permittivity) and {\(\mu\)} (the permeability). A typical aim in fusion plasma physics is to keep the amount of particles hitting {\(\partial \Omega\)} as small as possible (since they damage the reactor wall), while the control costs should not be too exhaustive (to ensure efficiency). This leads to a minimizing problem with a PDE constraint. This problem is analyzed in detail. In particular, we prove existence of minimizers and establish an approach to derive first order optimality conditions.},

  abstract = {We investigate stability issues for steady states of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Vlasov system numerically in Schwarzschild, maximal areal, and Eddington--Finkelstein coordinates. Across all coordinate systems we confirm the conjecture that the first binding energy maximum along a one-parameter family of steady states signals the onset of instability. Beyond this maximum perturbed solutions either collapse to a black hole, form heteroclinic orbits, or eventually fully disperse. Contrary to earlier research, we find that a negative binding energy does not necessarily correspond to fully dispersing solutions. We also comment on the so-called turning point principle from the viewpoint of our numerical results. The physical reliability of the latter is strengthened by obtaining consistent results in the three different coordinate systems and by the systematic use of dynamically accessible perturbations.},

In this work, the setting is two and one-half dimensional, that is, the distribution functions of the particles species are independent of the third space dimension.

After discussing global well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem, we construct stationary solutions whose support stays away from the wall of the confinement device. Then, in the main part of this work we investigate the stability of such steady states, both with respect to perturbations of the initial data, where we employ the energy-Casimir method, and also with respect to perturbations of the external magnetic field.},

	abstract = {The Vlasov-Poisson system describes the time evolution of a plasma in the so-called collisionless regime. The investigation of a high-temperature plasma that is influenced by an exterior magnetic field is one of the most significant aspects of thermonuclear fusion research. In this paper, we formulate and analyze a kinetic optimal control problem for the Vlasov-Poisson system where the control is represented by an external magnetic field. The main goal of such optimal control problems is to confine the plasma in a certain region in phase space. We first investigate the optimal control problem in terms of mathematical analysis, i.e., we show the existence of at least one global minimizer and we rigorously derive a first-order necessary optimality condition for local minimizers by the adjoint approach. Then, we build a Monte Carlo framework to solve the state equations as well as the adjoint equations by means of a Particle-In-Cell method, and we apply a nonlinear conjugate gradient method to solve the optimization problem. Eventually, we present numerical experiments that successfully validate our optimization framework.},

	abstract = {We study steady axisymmetric water waves with general vorticity and swirl, subject to the influence of surface tension. Explicit solutions to such a water wave problem are static configurations where the surface is an unduloid, that is, a periodic surface of revolution with constant mean curvature. We prove that to any such configuration there connects a global continuum of non-static solutions by means of a global implicit function theorem. To prove this, the key is strict monotonicity of a certain function describing the mean curvature of an unduloid and involving complete elliptic integrals. From this point of view, this paper is an interesting interplay between water waves, geometry, and properties of elliptic integrals.},
