	title = {Rigidity of symmetric doubly-periodic water waves near shear flows},
	abstract = {We prove that symmetric, doubly periodic, capillary-gravity water waves in finite depth bifurcating from non-uniform non-stagnant shear flows are necessarily two-dimensional to leading order. This is in stark contrast to the case of uniform background flows, where the existence of truly three-dimensional bifurcating waves is well known. While this paper focuses on capillary-gravity water waves, our proof also applies to other suitable types of dynamic boundary conditions, such as hydroelastic waves.},

	title = {An improved upper bound for the Froude number of irrotational solitary water waves},
	abstract = {A classical and central problem in the theory of water waves is to classify parameter regimes for which nontrivial solitary waves exist. In the two-dimensional, irrotational, pure gravity case, the Froude number {\(\textrm F\textrm r\)} (a non-dimensional wave speed) plays the central role. So far, the best analytic result {\(\textrm F\textrm r < \sqrt{2}\)} was obtained by Starr (1947), while the numerical evidence of Longuet-Higgins & Fenton (1974) states {\(\textrm F\textrm r \leq 1.294\)}. On the other hand, as shown recently by Kozlov (2023), the upper bound {\(\textrm F\textrm r < 1.399\)} is related to the existence of subharmonic bifurcations of Stokes waves. In this paper, we develop a new strategy utilizing the flow force function and rigorously establish the improved upper bound {\(\textrm F\textrm r < 1.37838\)}.},

	title = {Axisymmetric capillary water waves with vorticity and swirl connecting to static unduloid configurations},
	abstract = {We study steady axisymmetric water waves with general vorticity and swirl, subject to the influence of surface tension. Explicit solutions to such a water wave problem are static configurations where the surface is an unduloid, that is, a periodic surface of revolution with constant mean curvature. We prove that to any such configuration there connects a global continuum of non-static solutions by means of a global implicit function theorem. To prove this, the key is strict monotonicity of a certain function describing the mean curvature of an unduloid and involving complete elliptic integrals. From this point of view, this paper is an interesting interplay between water waves, geometry, and properties of elliptic integrals.},

	title = {Controlling a Vlasov--Poisson plasma by a Particle-In-Cell method based on a Monte Carlo framework},
	abstract = {The Vlasov-Poisson system describes the time evolution of a plasma in the so-called collisionless regime. The investigation of a high-temperature plasma that is influenced by an exterior magnetic field is one of the most significant aspects of thermonuclear fusion research. In this paper, we formulate and analyze a kinetic optimal control problem for the Vlasov-Poisson system where the control is represented by an external magnetic field. The main goal of such optimal control problems is to confine the plasma in a certain region in phase space. We first investigate the optimal control problem in terms of mathematical analysis, i.e., we show the existence of at least one global minimizer and we rigorously derive a first-order necessary optimality condition for local minimizers by the adjoint approach. Then, we build a Monte Carlo framework to solve the state equations as well as the adjoint equations by means of a Particle-In-Cell method, and we apply a nonlinear conjugate gradient method to solve the optimization problem. Eventually, we present numerical experiments that successfully validate our optimization framework.},

	abstract = {We consider two-dimensional steady periodic gravity waves on water of finite depth with a prescribed but arbitrary vorticity distribution. The water surface is allowed to be overhanging and no assumptions regarding the absence of stagnation points and critical layers are made. Using conformal mappings and a new reformulation of Bernoulli's equation, we uncover an equivalent formulation as “identity plus compact,” which is amenable to Rabinowitz's global bifurcation theorem. This allows us to construct a global connected set of solutions, bifurcating from laminar flows with a flat surface. Moreover, a nodal analysis is carried out for these solutions under a certain spectral assumption involving the vorticity function. Lastly, downstream waves are investigated in more detail.},

In this work, the setting is two and one-half dimensional, that is, the distribution functions of the particles species are independent of the third space dimension.

We only consider a two-dimensional version of the problem since existence of global, classical solutions of the full three-dimensional problem is not known. We add external currents to the system, in applications generated by coils, to control the plasma properly. After considering global existence of solutions to this system, differentiability of the control-to-state operator is proved. In applications, on the one hand, we want the shape of the plasma to be close to some desired shape. On the other hand, a cost term penalizing the external currents shall be as small as possible. These two aims lead to minimizing some objective function. We restrict ourselves to only such control currents that are realizable in applications. After that, we prove existence of a minimizer and deduce first order optimality conditions and the adjoint equation.},

Across all coordinate systems we confirm the conjecture that the first binding energy maximum along a one-parameter family of steady states signals the onset of instability. Beyond this maximum perturbed solutions either collapse to a black hole, form heteroclinic orbits, or eventually fully disperse. Contrary to earlier research, we find that a negative binding energy does not necessarily correspond to fully dispersing solutions. We also comment on the so-called turning point principle from the viewpoint of our numerical results. The physical reliability of the latter is strengthened by obtaining consistent results in the three different coordinate systems and by the systematic use of dynamically accessible perturbations.},

	abstract = {We consider the Vlasov--Poisson system that is equipped with an external magnetic field to describe the time evolution of the distribution function of a plasma. An optimal control problem where the external magnetic field is the control itself has already been investigated by Knopf (Calc Var 57:134, 2018). However, in real technical applications it will not be possible to choose the control field in such a general fashion as it will be induced by fixed field coils. In this paper we will use the fundamentals that were established by Knopf (Calc Var 57:134, 2018) to analyze an optimal control problem where the magnetic field is a superposition of the fields that are generated by {\(N\)} fixed magnetic field coils. Thereby, the aim is to control the plasma in such a way that its distribution function matches a desired distribution function at some certain final time {\(T\)} as closely as possible. This problem will be analyzed with respect to the following topics: existence of a globally optimal solution, necessary conditions of first order for local optimality, derivation of an optimality system, sufficient conditions of second order for local optimality and uniqueness of the optimal control under certain conditions.},
