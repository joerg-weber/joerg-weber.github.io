I am a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/), mentored by [Adrian Constantin](https://mathematik.univie.ac.at/en/about-us/staff/?api_pkey=36146&no_cache=1&api_task=member_details&api_lang=en). I obtained my doctorate in 2020 from the [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/en) under the supervision of [Gerhard Rein](https://www.diffgleichg.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/prof-rein/). Afterwards I was a postdoctoral fellow and researcher at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se), mentored by [Erik Wahl√©n](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/erik-wahlen).

My research concerns the analytical study of nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular within the scope of fluid mechanics and kinetic theory. My main interests include

<ul>
  <li>in oceanic fluid mechanics
    <ul>
      <li>steady water waves modelled by the full Euler equations,</li>
      <li>two-dimensional and axisymmetric waves with general vorticity,</li>
      <li>structural properties of water waves,</li>
      <li>geophysical water waves;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in atmospheric fluid mechanics
    <ul>
      <li>mountain waves,</li>
      <li>structures like the polar vortex;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in kinetic theory
    <ul>
      <li>analysis of kinetic equations such as Vlasov&mdash;Poisson or Vlasov&mdash;Maxwell,</li>
      <li>optimal control problems arising in plasma physics,</li>
      <li>construction and stability of confined stationary plasmas.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
